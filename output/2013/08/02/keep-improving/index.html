        <h1>Keep improving</h1>
        <p>About six months ago, I came to the conclusion that I needed to start thinking
about my future. The company I currently work at isn't growing as fast as
I am, so I started looking around to see how I could keep improving myself
and if that would be possible within this company. I learned a lot in the
years I work at the company, and always had a good time. So leaving the
company wasn't something I enjoyed thinking about. But after a while I came
to the conclusion I need to choose for myself, not for the company.</p>

<p>So I started looking around for the possibilities, trying to find out what
options I had in the Netherlands (because... that's were I live). Talked
to some people, tried to attend more conferences and user groups. At the
same time I started to contribute more to OpenSource. The more people I spoke
to and the more I saw and heared how other people were working, the more I
had the feeling I should be doing something else, there was so much I wanted
to do but wasn't able to at this moment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm hoping to find a job were I can work with Symfony, were I can use TDD
and other QA techniques and tools. A job were I can put my hearth and soul
in exploring the possibilities of new techniques and implementing those
techniques. And if that includes working on and with OpenSource, that would
be awesome!</p>
