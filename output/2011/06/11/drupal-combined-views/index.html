        <h1>Drupal and combined views</h1>
        <p>This week I started to work with Drupal 7, hadn’t worked with Drupal before, so was excited to explore the possibilities.</p>

<p>One of the goals was to familiarize  myself with Drupal and see if it is suited to create simple websites within a short time.</p>

<p>Somebody else started the project, so there were some blocks already created and a big piece of the theme was already build. I started with the thing I thought was most challenging, never expecting that to be pretty difficult.</p>

<p>The goal was about 2 entities, Services and Cases. Each Case having one service, and every Service having multiple Cases. I tried to create a page with 2 blocks, the first just plain text, the second a listing of Services. The challenge was to display the Cases for each Service in that same listing. Pretty soon I found that I required the module Views for that.</p>

<p>At first I tried with a module References, I created the 2 Entities, and added the Field Service to the Cases entity as a Node Reference</p>

<p>I did manage to join the two entities with a Relationship and grouping, but that didn’t got me very far. For every Case it would also repeat the Service description. After a lot of time in the Drupal IRC channel, I found that the problem was in the fact that I required more then 1 field from the Service Entity to be shown.</p>

<p>After a lot of help in the IRC channel, I found the following solution:</p>

<p>Just create 2 Views, one simple view with the Nodes of type Service. And a View with Nodes of type Cases, in that View I used a Contextual Filter for</p>

<p>In the template for the Description Field (in my case, can be any Field template), I called the function <code>views_embed_view</code>, that function does as the name says, it embeds another view. The first parameter is the machine_name of the view, the second paramater is the machine_name of the display in the view (You can find that under Advanced -> Other).</p>

<p>The third paramater Ihas some magic to it, because it accepts mixed data, but for me the following worked: <code>array(‘nid’ =&gt; $row-&gt;nid)</code>.</p>

<p>So the solution was to embed an View in a View, although there are modules that should do this, I haven’t found another way then modifying the template and using code.</p>

<p>I could write some sort of tutorial, a step by step explanation, just ask. For now this summary will do:</p>

<p>Used modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/references">References</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Created 2 Views, use <code>views_embed_view</code> to embed the second view into the first one.</p>

<p>Also I have to say, the help I got on IRC was amazing, I probably was as unclear as a newbie can be, but they kept on asking question until they knew what I required.
Thanks RumpledElf and damiankloip (and some others that made a suggestion)!</p>
