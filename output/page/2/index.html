    <p>On this blog I try to regularly talk about my experiences with development. To be honest, I tried this before, more than once... But this time it will be different!</p>
    <p>This time I'm going to make a list of stuff I want to talk about, and I'm setting a weekly reminder in my agenda to write a blogpost and/or think about more subjects.</p>

        <p>At the company I work at, we have a custom e-commerce
platform that’s in a need of replacement. The codebase is more then 6 years
old and by now, there are more exceptions that rules. The lack of actual MVC
implementation, an ORM or even a DBAL, made maintenance… not very pleasant.</p>

<p>Although we can’t just replace the platform, we did start looking at other
options to create a stable base for future development. For new features that
included a large bit of backend, we already created a new Symfony2 application.
That helped, but didn’t solve the spagetti frontend code. For some new frontend
features, we created a REST service in the Symfony2 application, and used
that in the old frontend application.</p>

<p>But to be able to create a new solid base for a new frontend we started looking
out for options. A completely custom Symfony2 application would simply cost to
much for the customer, a almost ready package as Magento is also an option, but
we weren’t really excited by the news of Ebay buying Magento.</p>

<p>We also looked at some Symfony2 Open Source projects, like Sylius and Vespolina.
Both projects weren’t very far when I started looking. But because Vespolina
started more as a Framework, I started to follow that project more closely.
After a few conversations on IRC with inspiran and iampersistent, I decided
to try and contribute to the project. At that point I had no idea if we ever
would be able to use Vespolina at our company, but I liked to project and just
wanted to help with an Open Source project.</p>

<p>I started with the Vespolina PartnerBundle. A bundle that would be responsible for creating and maintaining parterns in the application. A partner could be a lot more than a customer. It could also be a supplier, a company or a shop employee. The idea is, that the PartnerBundle could even be used in a CRM application.</p>

<p>We now are a few months further, and Vespolina is going steady. Unfortunately, I have little time to spare, so I can’t work on Vespolina as much as I like. At the company we haven’t made a decision about the platform, so I can’t spend time on Vespolina there.</p>

<p>I hope to create some time in the coming weeks. Really need to get going on the forms.</p>

            <h3><a href="/2011/06/11/drupal-combined-views">Drupal and combined views</a><span class="date">2011-06-11</span></h3>
        <p>This week I started to work with Drupal 7, hadn’t worked with Drupal before, so was excited to explore the possibilities.</p>

<p>One of the goals was to familiarize  myself with Drupal and see if it is suited to create simple websites within a short time.</p>

<p>Somebody else started the project, so there were some blocks already created and a big piece of the theme was already build. I started with the thing I thought was most challenging, never expecting that to be pretty difficult.</p>

<p>The goal was about 2 entities, Services and Cases. Each Case having one service, and every Service having multiple Cases. I tried to create a page with 2 blocks, the first just plain text, the second a listing of Services. The challenge was to display the Cases for each Service in that same listing. Pretty soon I found that I required the module Views for that.</p>

<p>At first I tried with a module References, I created the 2 Entities, and added the Field Service to the Cases entity as a Node Reference</p>

<p>I did manage to join the two entities with a Relationship and grouping, but that didn’t got me very far. For every Case it would also repeat the Service description. After a lot of time in the Drupal IRC channel, I found that the problem was in the fact that I required more then 1 field from the Service Entity to be shown.</p>

<p>After a lot of help in the IRC channel, I found the following solution:</p>

<p>Just create 2 Views, one simple view with the Nodes of type Service. And a View with Nodes of type Cases, in that View I used a Contextual Filter for</p>

<p>In the template for the Description Field (in my case, can be any Field template), I called the function <code>views_embed_view</code>, that function does as the name says, it embeds another view. The first parameter is the machine_name of the view, the second paramater is the machine_name of the display in the view (You can find that under Advanced -> Other).</p>

<p>The third paramater Ihas some magic to it, because it accepts mixed data, but for me the following worked: <code>array(‘nid’ =&gt; $row-&gt;nid)</code>.</p>

<p>So the solution was to embed an View in a View, although there are modules that should do this, I haven’t found another way then modifying the template and using code.</p>

<p>I could write some sort of tutorial, a step by step explanation, just ask. For now this summary will do:</p>

<p>Used modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/references">References</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Created 2 Views, use <code>views_embed_view</code> to embed the second view into the first one.</p>

<p>Also I have to say, the help I got on IRC was amazing, I probably was as unclear as a newbie can be, but they kept on asking question until they knew what I required.
Thanks RumpledElf and damiankloip (and some others that made a suggestion)!</p>
