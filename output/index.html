    <h1>Welcome on my blog</h1>
    <p>On this blog I try to regularly talk about my experiences with development. To be honest, I tried this before, more then once... But this time it will be different!</p>
    <p>This time I'm going to make a list of stuff I want to talk about, and I'm setting a weekly reminder in my agenda to write a blogpost and/or think about more subjects.</p>

            <h3><a href="/2013/09/15/my-first-uncon-talk">My first uncon talk</a><span class="date">2013-09-15</span></h3>
        <p>About 2 months ago, when <a href="http://010php.nl">010php</a> started, I started playing with the idea of giving talks myself. At first
I was pretty anxious to actually execute that plan. I talked with some people that I had the idea and they all encouraged
me to do it. So I started writing down some ideas I already had. But until last week, I didn't actually had a talk planned
anywhere.</p>

<p>But last Tuesday, <a href="http://twitter.com/the_linie">Lineke</a> asked me if I would give a uncon talk at <a href="http://pfcongres.nl">PFcongres 2013</a>,
I don't think she new I was already playing with the idea, but she was very convincing and I said I would do my best to prepare
something.</p>

<p>Because of limited time, I started to prepare the evening before the conference, at that point I hadn't even decided what
subject I would choose for the talk... I decided on PHPCR and luckily the preperation went fairly well and I even rehearsed
it once!</p>

<p>So yesterday the conference was there, and on my way in the train I even managed to talk myself into a calmer state. Don't
get me wrong, I was still nervous as hell... just a bit less then before. I spoke to Linke en we planned my talk at 12.10.
After that I just went to the talks, trying not to think about it to much anymore. At <a href="http://joind.in/talk/view/8955">the talk just before my uncon slot</a>,
I got a bit nervous when Joshua already mentioned he didn't now if he would be done in time. Should I leave the talk early
to be on time? Should I just leave with everybody else? Eventually I decided that I would leave 5 minutes before my talk
started. That gave me some time to visit a restroom (to much coffee...), and still be on time for my talk. This meant I
walked out while Joshua was still answering some questions (sorry for that), but it made me feel a bit better.</p>

<p>Giving the talk went pretty well, of course I forgot to bring a VGA connector, but I could use Lineke's (thanks!). I pretty
much gave my talk as intended (only forgot to tell 1 thing), and got some good questions, so apparently people weren't bored
to death :)
Just before the end of my talk I noticed myself saying <em>Uhh</em> between pretty much every sentence, so I learned something
<strong>while</strong> giving the talk!</p>

<p>After the talk Lineke already gave me some feedback (she noticed the <em>Uhh</em>'s as well) and I spoke some people that had
seen it.
Another important thing I learned, is that a topic like PHPCR is very hard to explain, and nearly impossible to explain in
10-15 minutes, so next time I would probably want a 50min slot and I need to rethink how I can explain the subject to people
that have no clue about it. On a sidenote: you can still comment on my talk, so <strong>please</strong> <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/9216">leave feedback</a>!</p>

<p>All with all was it a great experience and I'm certain I will do it again. Maybe I'll even submit a actual talk to a conference
next year.</p>

            <h3><a href="/2013/08/16/vespolina-hackweekend">Vespolina hackweekend</a><span class="date">2013-08-16</span></h3>
        <p>As I mentioned in <a href="/2012/06/02/working-on-opensource/">Working on an OpenSource project</a>,
I'm somewhat involved with <a href="http://www.vespolina.org">Vespolina</a>.
Last weekend we had our first hackweekend, <a href="https://github.com/inspiran">Daniel</a>
and I sat together, and <a href="https://github.com/iampersistent">Richard</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/cordoval">Luis</a> joined us remote. On friday evening
we had a conference call where <a href="https://github.com/hacfi">Philipp</a> also
joined us. In that conference call we talked a bit about what we wanted
to do that weekend.</p>

<p>The biggest change that we did that weekend, was merging some of the libraries
together in 1 lirbary. This to make it easier for people to start working
with Vespolina, and the make development easier, because maintaining around
40 repositories isn't trivial. Eventually the following libraries got merged
into <a href="https://github.com/vespolina/commerce">a single library</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Billing</li>
<li>Invoice</li>
<li>Order</li>
<li>Partner</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Product</li>
</ul>

<p>So essentially everything that was already done with the CommerceBundle,
but now for the libraries.</p>

<p>And I continued working on the new website and a bit on the documentation. The
website is almost finished, just needs some more content and probably some minor
bugfixes. But the documentation still needs lots of work.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I hope to continue working on writing documentation
and focus on writing more tests. The combination is probably a good way
to learn Vespolina better and hopefully lead to better documentation and tests.</p>

            <h3><a href="/2013/08/02/keep-improving">Keep improving</a><span class="date">2013-08-02</span></h3>
        <p>About six months ago, I came to the conclusion that I needed to start thinking
about my future. The company I currently work at isn't growing as fast as
I am, so I started looking around to see how I could keep improving myself
and if that would be possible within this company. I learned a lot in the
years I work at the company, and always had a good time. So leaving the
company wasn't something I enjoyed thinking about. But after a while I came
to the conclusion I need to choose for myself, not for the company.</p>

<p>So I started looking around for the possibilities, trying to find out what
options I had in the Netherlands (because... that's were I live). Talked
to some people, tried to attend more conferences and user groups. At the
same time I started to contribute more to OpenSource. The more people I spoke
to and the more I saw and heared how other people were working, the more I
had the feeling I should be doing something else, there was so much I wanted
to do but wasn't able to at this moment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm hoping to find a job were I can work with Symfony, were I can use TDD
and other QA techniques and tools. A job were I can put my hearth and soul
in exploring the possibilities of new techniques and implementing those
techniques. And if that includes working on and with OpenSource, that would
be awesome!</p>

            <h3><a href="/2013/07/26/new-blog">A new blog</a><span class="date">2013-07-26</span></h3>
        <p>Okay, so I started a new blog again.
This time I have the plan to force myself to write a post at least every 2 weeks,
but when possible every week. It's going to be hard, especially in the beginning.
But I think it's good for me to write down what I'm doing.</p>

<p>As this is the first post, I'll write about the software I used to build this.
It's called <a href="https://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a>, and it's a static site generator
written in PHP. It allows you to create a design with <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">Twig</a> templates and
then write posts in any markup language you like (I'm using Markdown).</p>

<p>I like the fact that I can easily write a post now while being offline and
just deploy the project when I get online. The lack of a database is just
a nice elimination of another thing that can go wrong.</p>

<p>And for syntax highlighting I now use <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a>. A nice javascript library.
Sculpin supports Markdown Extra, so I can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>~~~language-markup
&lt;div id="foo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="bar"&gt;foobar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
~~~
</code></pre>

<p>And that will produce:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="foo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="bar"&gt;foobar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>PHP Example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
    $kernel = new AppKernel();
    $kernel-&gt;handle(Request::createFromGlobals());
    $kernel-&gt;terminate();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And of course there are more languages it can highlight.</p>

<p>I only haven't figured out how I can use the <a href="http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/">line-numbers</a> plugin within Markdown.</p>

        <p>A few days back, I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/lsmith/status/283840720228470784">this tweet</a> of Lukas Smith.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>has anyone written a #composerphp script to check which installed Bundles are not enabled in the applications #Symfony2 kernel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first I just skipped it, thinking ‘Nope, next tweet’. But then I realized, it can’t be that hard, why don’t I build it?</p>

<p>So I started to work on it, and this time I actually finished it (probably because it didn’t take 2 weeks to build).
It was a nice little project, got to know Composer a bit better, got some more experience with UnitTesting (still need to write more tests though), had another go with Travis and submitted my first package to packagist.</p>

<p>I hope this gets met going again to actually make time to work on OSS (like Vespolina!).</p>
