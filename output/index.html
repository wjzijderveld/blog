    <p>On this blog I try to regularly talk about my experiences with development. To be honest, I tried this before, more than once... But this time it will be different!</p>

            <h3><a href="http://blog.willem-jan.net/2013/11/05/symfony-cmf">Symfony CMF</a><span class="date">2013-11-05</span></h3>
        <p>Today I got into a discussion about <a href="http://cmf.symfony.com">Symfony CMF</a>. The discussion started with the question, if Symfony CMF isn't trying
to create a solution for a problem that doesn't exists. That person thought CMF only solved a developers problem, but
couldn't solve the problems for front-end developers or editors (or even added more problems). It came down to it, that
he had seen the admin interfaces that come with Symfony CMF and saw that it was... less from perfect (to put it nice).</p>

<h4>Goals of Symfony CMF</h4>

<p>Symfony CMF aims to provide a toolbox to create your own custom CMS, not by reinventing the wheel, but by reusing
existing code and sharing the produced code (parts of it will be used in Drupal 8). It aims to make it easier for
developers to add CMS functionality to applications built on Symfony 2.</p>

<h4>PHPCR</h4>

<p>To do that, they looked at other solutions, solutions not limited to PHP, to structure content. This because a CMS has
mostly unstructured data, and forcing this into a RDBMS isn't always a good fit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">Graph database</a> are a better
fit. They found <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JCR</a>, a Java specification that deals with content. They ported that to PHP and called it <a href="https://github.com/phpcr/" title="PHPCR Github">PHPCR</a>;
PHP Content Repository. With PHPCR, there is an API to interface with your content repository.</p>

<h4>What is doesn't solve</h4>

<p>Althought Symfony CMF does provide some basic admin interfaces (with Sonata Admin), it isn't meant as an end product.
For most customers and editors, those screens just won't be enough. But there is nothing to stop you from developing
your own admin screens that does fit you customers needs.</p>

<p>Symfony CMF isn't a solution aimed at the end-user, that is still you job as a developer, to implement a solution that
helps your end-user and the editors. Symfony CMF just helps you to not get a panic attack when somebody tells you to add
content management to your Symfony2 application.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned 2 months ago, I believe it's important to keep developing yourself. You can't just sit there and
repeat the same trick every time. I also told that I wanted to do that by trying to find a new job, and by attending
more conferences and user groups.</p>

<p>But that all isn't that easy, I couldn't attend my user group because of a agenda conflict (and missing the next one as well)
and conferences are just to expensive to pay for by myself.</p>

<p>The work part isn't much better as well. I shouldn't complain, I still have a job! But at that job it is hard to find a
challenge, and there is a lot of repetitive work involved. And because there is a lot of Drupal involved, OOP isn't part
of my daily routine anymore, and that sucks.</p>

<p>While searching for a new job, I have found a company were I really want to work. The first job interview went well and
they are open to further conversation, but the sad part is, that they don't have a spot at this moment and they don't
know on what term they will.
And that's a pretty difficult time for me, I really want that job, but I'm not sure if I should wait for it. At this point
I'm not even sure if I actually would get hired, so is it worth the risk?</p>

<p>And with all this, it's hard to keep myself busy on the level were I want to be (and grow from there), At work there isn't
much room for it, and at home I can't spend the time at it that I would like (my wife would like some attention now and then :-) ).
So I try to put some time in a JAVA project I started 6 months ago, at least I'm working on a OO project.</p>

<p>Any tips how to deal with such a time would be greatly appreciated! Sometimes I have the feeling I'm just not patient enough,
that I should just wait, and be grateful I have a job.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://blog.willem-jan.net/2013/09/15/my-first-uncon-talk">My first uncon talk</a><span class="date">2013-09-15</span></h3>
        <p>About 2 months ago, when <a href="http://010php.nl">010php</a> started, I started playing with the idea of giving talks myself. At first
I was pretty anxious to actually execute that plan. I talked with some people that I had the idea and they all encouraged
me to do it. So I started writing down some ideas I already had. But until last week, I didn't actually had a talk planned
anywhere.</p>

<p>But last Tuesday, <a href="http://twitter.com/the_linie">Lineke</a> asked me if I would give a uncon talk at <a href="http://pfcongres.nl">PFcongres 2013</a>,
I don't think she new I was already playing with the idea, but she was very convincing and I said I would do my best to prepare
something.</p>

<p>Because of limited time, I started to prepare the evening before the conference, at that point I hadn't even decided what
subject I would choose for the talk... I decided on PHPCR and luckily the preperation went fairly well and I even rehearsed
it once!</p>

<p>So yesterday the conference was there, and on my way in the train I even managed to talk myself into a calmer state. Don't
get me wrong, I was still nervous as hell... just a bit less then before. I spoke to Linke en we planned my talk at 12.10.
After that I just went to the talks, trying not to think about it to much anymore. At <a href="http://joind.in/talk/view/8955">the talk just before my uncon slot</a>,
I got a bit nervous when Joshua already mentioned he didn't now if he would be done in time. Should I leave the talk early
to be on time? Should I just leave with everybody else? Eventually I decided that I would leave 5 minutes before my talk
started. That gave me some time to visit a restroom (to much coffee...), and still be on time for my talk. This meant I
walked out while Joshua was still answering some questions (sorry for that), but it made me feel a bit better.</p>

<p>Giving the talk went pretty well, of course I forgot to bring a VGA connector, but I could use Lineke's (thanks!). I pretty
much gave my talk as intended (only forgot to tell 1 thing), and got some good questions, so apparently people weren't bored
to death :)
Just before the end of my talk I noticed myself saying <em>Uhh</em> between pretty much every sentence, so I learned something
<strong>while</strong> giving the talk!</p>

<p>After the talk Lineke already gave me some feedback (she noticed the <em>Uhh</em>'s as well) and I spoke some people that had
seen it.
Another important thing I learned, is that a topic like PHPCR is very hard to explain, and nearly impossible to explain in
10-15 minutes, so next time I would probably want a 50min slot and I need to rethink how I can explain the subject to people
that have no clue about it. On a sidenote: you can still comment on my talk, so <strong>please</strong> <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/9216">leave feedback</a>!</p>

<p>All with all was it a great experience and I'm certain I will do it again. Maybe I'll even submit a actual talk to a conference
next year.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://blog.willem-jan.net/2013/08/16/vespolina-hackweekend">Vespolina hackweekend</a><span class="date">2013-08-16</span></h3>
        <p>As I mentioned in <a href="/2012/06/02/working-on-opensource/">Working on an OpenSource project</a>,
I'm somewhat involved with <a href="http://www.vespolina.org">Vespolina</a>.
Last weekend we had our first hackweekend, <a href="https://github.com/inspiran">Daniel</a>
and I sat together, and <a href="https://github.com/iampersistent">Richard</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/cordoval">Luis</a> joined us remote. On friday evening
we had a conference call where <a href="https://github.com/hacfi">Philipp</a> also
joined us. In that conference call we talked a bit about what we wanted
to do that weekend.</p>

<p>The biggest change that we did that weekend, was merging some of the libraries
together in 1 lirbary. This to make it easier for people to start working
with Vespolina, and the make development easier, because maintaining around
40 repositories isn't trivial. Eventually the following libraries got merged
into <a href="https://github.com/vespolina/commerce">a single library</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Billing</li>
<li>Invoice</li>
<li>Order</li>
<li>Partner</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Product</li>
</ul>

<p>So essentially everything that was already done with the CommerceBundle,
but now for the libraries.</p>

<p>And I continued working on the new website and a bit on the documentation. The
website is almost finished, just needs some more content and probably some minor
bugfixes. But the documentation still needs lots of work.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I hope to continue working on writing documentation
and focus on writing more tests. The combination is probably a good way
to learn Vespolina better and hopefully lead to better documentation and tests.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://blog.willem-jan.net/2013/08/02/keep-improving">Keep improving</a><span class="date">2013-08-02</span></h3>
        <p>About six months ago, I came to the conclusion that I needed to start thinking
about my future. The company I currently work at isn't growing as fast as
I am, so I started looking around to see how I could keep improving myself
and if that would be possible within this company. I learned a lot in the
years I work at the company, and always had a good time. So leaving the
company wasn't something I enjoyed thinking about. But after a while I came
to the conclusion I need to choose for myself, not for the company.</p>

<p>So I started looking around for the possibilities, trying to find out what
options I had in the Netherlands (because... that's were I live). Talked
to some people, tried to attend more conferences and user groups. At the
same time I started to contribute more to OpenSource. The more people I spoke
to and the more I saw and heared how other people were working, the more I
had the feeling I should be doing something else, there was so much I wanted
to do but wasn't able to at this moment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm hoping to find a job were I can work with Symfony, were I can use TDD
and other QA techniques and tools. A job were I can put my hearth and soul
in exploring the possibilities of new techniques and implementing those
techniques. And if that includes working on and with OpenSource, that would
be awesome!</p>
