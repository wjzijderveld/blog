            <title>Keep improving</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>About six months ago, I came to the conclusion that I needed to start thinking
about my future. The company I currently work at isn't growing as fast as
I am, so I started looking around to see how I could keep improving myself
and if that would be possible within this company. I learned a lot in the
years I work at the company, and always had a good time. So leaving the
company wasn't something I enjoyed thinking about. But after a while I came
to the conclusion I need to choose for myself, not for the company.</p>

<p>So I started looking around for the possibilities, trying to find out what
options I had in the Netherlands (because... that's were I live). Talked
to some people, tried to attend more conferences and user groups. At the
same time I started to contribute more to OpenSource. The more people I spoke
to and the more I saw and heared how other people were working, the more I
had the feeling I should be doing something else, there was so much I wanted
to do but wasn't able to at this moment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm hoping to find a job were I can work with Symfony, were I can use TDD
and other QA techniques and tools. A job were I can put my hearth and soul
in exploring the possibilities of new techniques and implementing those
techniques. And if that includes working on and with OpenSource, that would
be awesome!</p>

            <title>A new blog</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so I started a new blog again.
This time I have the plan to force myself to write a post at least every 2 weeks,
but when possible every week. It's going to be hard, especially in the beginning.
But I think it's good for me to write down what I'm doing.</p>

<p>As this is the first post, I'll write about the software I used to build this.
It's called <a href="https://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a>, and it's a static site generator
written in PHP. It allows you to create a design with <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">Twig</a> templates and
then write posts in any markup language you like (I'm using Markdown).</p>

<p>I like the fact that I can easily write a post now while being offline and
just deploy the project when I get online. The lack of a database is just
a nice elimination of another thing that can go wrong.</p>

<p>And for syntax highlighting I now use <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a>. A nice javascript library.
Sculpin supports Markdown Extra, so I can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>~~~language-markup
&lt;div id="foo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="bar"&gt;foobar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
~~~
</code></pre>

<p>And that will produce:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="foo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="bar"&gt;foobar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>PHP Example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
    $kernel = new AppKernel();
    $kernel-&gt;handle(Request::createFromGlobals());
    $kernel-&gt;terminate();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And of course there are more languages it can highlight.</p>

<p>I only haven't figured out how I can use the <a href="http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/">line-numbers</a> plugin within Markdown.</p>
