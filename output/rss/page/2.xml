            <title>My first uncon talk</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>About 2 months ago, when <a href="http://010php.nl">010php</a> started, I started playing with the idea of giving talks myself. At first
I was pretty anxious to actually execute that plan. I talked with some people that I had the idea and they all encouraged
me to do it. So I started writing down some ideas I already had. But until last week, I didn't actually had a talk planned
anywhere.</p>

<p>But last Tuesday, <a href="http://twitter.com/the_linie">Lineke</a> asked me if I would give a uncon talk at <a href="http://pfcongres.nl">PFcongres 2013</a>,
I don't think she new I was already playing with the idea, but she was very convincing and I said I would do my best to prepare
something.</p>

<p>Because of limited time, I started to prepare the evening before the conference, at that point I hadn't even decided what
subject I would choose for the talk... I decided on PHPCR and luckily the preperation went fairly well and I even rehearsed
it once!</p>

<p>So yesterday the conference was there, and on my way in the train I even managed to talk myself into a calmer state. Don't
get me wrong, I was still nervous as hell... just a bit less then before. I spoke to Linke en we planned my talk at 12.10.
After that I just went to the talks, trying not to think about it to much anymore. At <a href="http://joind.in/talk/view/8955">the talk just before my uncon slot</a>,
I got a bit nervous when Joshua already mentioned he didn't now if he would be done in time. Should I leave the talk early
to be on time? Should I just leave with everybody else? Eventually I decided that I would leave 5 minutes before my talk
started. That gave me some time to visit a restroom (to much coffee...), and still be on time for my talk. This meant I
walked out while Joshua was still answering some questions (sorry for that), but it made me feel a bit better.</p>

<p>Giving the talk went pretty well, of course I forgot to bring a VGA connector, but I could use Lineke's (thanks!). I pretty
much gave my talk as intended (only forgot to tell 1 thing), and got some good questions, so apparently people weren't bored
to death :)
Just before the end of my talk I noticed myself saying <em>Uhh</em> between pretty much every sentence, so I learned something
<strong>while</strong> giving the talk!</p>

<p>After the talk Lineke already gave me some feedback (she noticed the <em>Uhh</em>'s as well) and I spoke some people that had
seen it.
Another important thing I learned, is that a topic like PHPCR is very hard to explain, and nearly impossible to explain in
10-15 minutes, so next time I would probably want a 50min slot and I need to rethink how I can explain the subject to people
that have no clue about it. On a sidenote: you can still comment on my talk, so <strong>please</strong> <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/9216">leave feedback</a>!</p>

<p>All with all was it a great experience and I'm certain I will do it again. Maybe I'll even submit a actual talk to a conference
next year.</p>

            <title>Vespolina hackweekend</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in <a href="/2012/06/02/working-on-opensource/">Working on an OpenSource project</a>,
I'm somewhat involved with <a href="http://www.vespolina.org">Vespolina</a>.
Last weekend we had our first hackweekend, <a href="https://github.com/inspiran">Daniel</a>
and I sat together, and <a href="https://github.com/iampersistent">Richard</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/cordoval">Luis</a> joined us remote. On friday evening
we had a conference call where <a href="https://github.com/hacfi">Philipp</a> also
joined us. In that conference call we talked a bit about what we wanted
to do that weekend.</p>

<p>The biggest change that we did that weekend, was merging some of the libraries
together in 1 lirbary. This to make it easier for people to start working
with Vespolina, and the make development easier, because maintaining around
40 repositories isn't trivial. Eventually the following libraries got merged
into <a href="https://github.com/vespolina/commerce">a single library</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Billing</li>
<li>Invoice</li>
<li>Order</li>
<li>Partner</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Product</li>
</ul>

<p>So essentially everything that was already done with the CommerceBundle,
but now for the libraries.</p>

<p>And I continued working on the new website and a bit on the documentation. The
website is almost finished, just needs some more content and probably some minor
bugfixes. But the documentation still needs lots of work.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I hope to continue working on writing documentation
and focus on writing more tests. The combination is probably a good way
to learn Vespolina better and hopefully lead to better documentation and tests.</p>
