        <h1>Working on an OpenSource project</h1>
        <p>At the company I work at, we have a custom e-commerce
platform that’s in a need of replacement. The codebase is more then 6 years
old and by now, there are more exceptions that rules. The lack of actual MVC
implementation, an ORM or even a DBAL, made maintenance… not very pleasant.</p>

<p>Although we can’t just replace the platform, we did start looking at other
options to create a stable base for future development. For new features that
included a large bit of backend, we already created a new Symfony2 application.
That helped, but didn’t solve the spagetti frontend code. For some new frontend
features, we created a REST service in the Symfony2 application, and used
that in the old frontend application.</p>

<p>But to be able to create a new solid base for a new frontend we started looking
out for options. A completely custom Symfony2 application would simply cost to
much for the customer, a almost ready package as Magento is also an option, but
we weren’t really excited by the news of Ebay buying Magento.</p>

<p>We also looked at some Symfony2 Open Source projects, like Sylius and Vespolina.
Both projects weren’t very far when I started looking. But because Vespolina
started more as a Framework, I started to follow that project more closely.
After a few conversations on IRC with inspiran and iampersistent, I decided
to try and contribute to the project. At that point I had no idea if we ever
would be able to use Vespolina at our company, but I liked to project and just
wanted to help with an Open Source project.</p>

<p>I started with the Vespolina PartnerBundle. A bundle that would be responsible for creating and maintaining parterns in the application. A partner could be a lot more than a customer. It could also be a supplier, a company or a shop employee. The idea is, that the PartnerBundle could even be used in a CRM application.</p>

<p>We now are a few months further, and Vespolina is going steady. Unfortunately, I have little time to spare, so I can’t work on Vespolina as much as I like. At the company we haven’t made a decision about the platform, so I can’t spend time on Vespolina there.</p>

<p>I hope to create some time in the coming weeks. Really need to get going on the forms.</p>
