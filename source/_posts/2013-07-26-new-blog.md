title: A new blog

Okay, so I started a new blog again.
This time I have the plan to force myself to write a post at least every 2 weeks,
but when possible every week. It's going to be hard, especially in the beginning.
But I think it's good for me to write down what I'm doing.

As this is the first post, I'll write about the software I used to build this.
It's called [Sculpin], and it's a static site generator
written in PHP. It allows you to create a design with [Twig] templates and
then write posts in any markup language you like (I'm using Markdown).

I like the fact that I can easily write a post now while being offline and
just deploy the project when I get online. The lack of a database is just
a nice elimination of another thing that can go wrong.

And for syntax highlighting I now use [Prism.js]. A nice javascript library.
Sculpin supports Markdown Extra, so I can do the following:


    ~~~language-markup
    <div id="foo">
        <span class="bar">foobar</span>
    </div>
    ~~~

And that will produce:

~~~language-markup
<div id="foo">
    <span class="bar">foobar</span>
</div>
~~~

PHP Example:

~~~language-php
<?php
    $kernel = new AppKernel();
    $kernel->handle(Request::createFromGlobals());
    $kernel->terminate();
?>
~~~

And of course there are more languages it can highlight.

I only haven't figured out how I can use the [line-numbers](http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/) plugin within Markdown.
