title: Created a little bundle check library

A few days back, I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/lsmith/status/283840720228470784) of Lukas Smith.

> has anyone written a #composerphp script to check which installed Bundles are not enabled in the applications #Symfony2 kernel?


At first I just skipped it, thinking ‘Nope, next tweet’. But then I realized, it can’t be that hard, why don’t I build it?

So I started to work on it, and this time I actually finished it (probably because it didn’t take 2 weeks to build).
It was a nice little project, got to know Composer a bit better, got some more experience with UnitTesting (still need to write more tests though), had another go with Travis and submitted my first package to packagist.

I hope this gets met going again to actually make time to work on OSS (like Vespolina!).
