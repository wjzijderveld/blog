About six months ago, I came to the conclusion that I needed to start thinking
about my future. The company I currently work at isn't growing as fast as
I am, so I started looking around to see how I could keep improving myself
and if that would be possible within this company. I learned a lot in the
years I work at the company, and always had a good time. So leaving the
company wasn't something I enjoyed thinking about. But after a while I came
to the conclusion I need to choose for myself, not for the company.

So I started looking around for the possibilities, trying to find out what
options I had in the Netherlands (because... that's were I live). Talked
to some people, tried to attend more conferences and user groups. At the
same time I started to contribute more to OpenSource. The more people I spoke
to and the more I saw and heared how other people were working, the more I
had the feeling I should be doing something else, there was so much I wanted
to do but wasn't able to at this moment.

{# Today I had my first job interview. It was a good talk, there is just one
thing that keeps bugging me a bit. They are looking for someone with a
master in Computer Science. I understand that people are looking for a level
of expertise, but in my experience a piece of paper doesn't guarantee that
somebody is a good developer and is able to adapt new techniques in a certain
time. And on the other hand, is the lack of such a paper no proof that person
isn't suited for the job.
And again, I understand why people would look for a certain degree. And I'm
happy a got invite for an interview, but I'm afraid some companies would
just ignore a #}

I'm hoping to find a job were I can work with Symfony, were I can use TDD
and other QA techniques and tools. A job were I can put my hard and soul
in exploring the possibilities of new techniques and implementing those
techniques. And if that includes working on and with OpenSource, that would
be awesome!
